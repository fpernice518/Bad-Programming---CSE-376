Homework 2: Extra Credit

======README=======

I believe I have been able to demonstrate the following Electric Fence features

 * Underflow protection
 * overflow protection
 * free protection

I have provided sample code which demonstrates this. Of course, the code must
be fun with gdb in order to show Electric Fence's true potential.

The provided Makefile can be used to build each of the source files with different EF
flags (the pattern (%) should be replaced with the name of the source file minus the.c)

 -  %               = no electric fence at all
 -  %-efence        = efence with default flags
 -  %-efence-pbelow = efence with undeflow protection
 -  %-efence-pfree  = efence with free protection


------------------

As seen in the Make Dependency folder, I believe I've implemented the dependency 
target to the best of my ability.
